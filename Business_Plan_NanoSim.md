# Business Plan: NanoSim Platform
## Multi-Scale Nanomedicine Simulation Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Confidentiality:** Internal Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

**Company Name:** NanoSim (working name)  
**Mission:** Democratize multi-scale drug delivery simulation through open-source technology while building sustainable commercial value  
**Vision:** Become the standard platform for nanomedicine researchers worldwide

### The Opportunity
The nanomedicine market is projected to reach $350+ billion by 2030, yet researchers lack integrated tools for multi-scale simulation. Current solutions are fragmented, expensive (COMSOL licenses ~$10K+/year), and require deep expertise across multiple domains. NanoSim bridges this gap.

### Business Model
**Hybrid Open Source + Commercial (Open-Core Model)**
- Free: Open-source core for individual researchers and students
- Paid: Enterprise features, hosted cloud platform, professional services
- Revenue Streams: SaaS subscriptions, enterprise licenses, consulting, grants

### Funding Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Bootstrap + Academic grants (~$0-50K)
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-18):** Pre-seed/Seed funding (~$200K-500K)
- **Phase 3 (Months 19-36):** Series A for scale (~$2-5M)

### Financial Projections (Conservative)
- **Year 1:** -$50K (grants cover dev costs, no revenue)
- **Year 2:** $100K revenue (10 paid enterprise users @ $10K/year)
- **Year 3:** $500K revenue (25 enterprise + 200 SaaS users)
- **Year 5:** $2-5M revenue (100+ enterprise clients, 1000+ SaaS users)

## 10. Open Source Strategy

### 10.1 Why Open Source?

**Strategic Benefits:**
1. **Community adoption** - Lowers barrier to entry
2. **Trust & transparency** - Critical for academic users
3. **Contribution model** - Users fix bugs, add features
4. **Marketing engine** - Word of mouth, GitHub visibility
5. **Talent attraction** - Engineers want to work on OSS
6. **Network effects** - More users = more valuable
7. **Competitive moat** - Hard for competitors to replicate community

**Risks:**
- Competitors can fork
- Some users never pay
- Support burden

**Mitigation:**
- Strong brand and community
- Commercial features that are hard to replicate
- Cloud hosting = convenience = willingness to pay

### 10.2 Licensing Strategy

**Recommended License: AGPLv3**

**Why AGPL:**
- Allows free use for research, education
- Requires sharing modifications (protects against forks)
- "SaaS loophole" closed (if someone hosts it, must share code)
- Compatible with commercial licensing (dual license possible)

**Alternative: Elastic License 2.0**
- Not true open source, but source-available
- Prevents cloud providers from competing
- More business-friendly

**Dual Licensing Model:**
- AGPLv3 for community
- Commercial license for companies who don't want AGPL obligations
- Additional revenue stream

### 10.3 Community Governance

**Open Source Best Practices:**
- Clear contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Code of conduct
- Public roadmap and issue tracker
- Regular releases with changelogs
- Responsive to issues and PRs
- Credit contributors prominently

**Commercial Balance:**
- Core features: Open source
- Enterprise features: Proprietary
- Cloud hosting: Proprietary infrastructure
- Be transparent about what's open vs. closed

**Foundation (Future):**
- Consider creating NanoSim Foundation (Year 3+)
- Neutral governance
- Multiple company sponsors
- Protects project if company pivots

## 11. Sustainability Beyond Profit

### 11.1 Mission Alignment

**Primary Mission:**
Accelerate nanomedicine research and drug development to improve human health

**How Business Model Supports Mission:**
- Free tier = accessible to students, developing countries
- Open source = global collaboration
- Grants fund non-commercial features
- Enterprise revenue sustains platform long-term

### 11.2 Social Impact

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Number of researchers using platform
- Papers published using NanoSim
- Drugs developed with platform assistance
- Educational impact (students trained)
- Reduction in animal testing (via simulation)

**Impact Metrics (Year 5):**
- 10,000+ researchers using platform
- 100+ papers citing NanoSim
- 5+ drugs in clinical trials using platform
- 50+ universities teaching with NanoSim

### 11.3 Long-Term Sustainability Models

**If Non-Profit Path Preferred:**
- Structure as 501(c)(3) or B-Corp
- Grant-funded development
- Donations from industry
- Service contracts with pharma
- Training revenue

**If For-Profit:**
- Can still maintain mission-driven focus
- Profit → reinvest in R&D
- Free tier for academia maintained
- Open source core protected

**Hybrid Model (Recommended):**
- For-profit company
- Open source core
- Percentage of revenue to foundation
- Academic partnership program
- Ethical pricing (academic discounts)
